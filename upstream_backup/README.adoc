= Upstream backup

== How works?
image::./assets/All servers ok.png[All servers ok, 450]
When all servers are ok, nginx will send request to the servers

---

image::./assets/Server1 down.png[Server1 down, 450]
If for example Server1 is down, nginx will try to use Server1, if Server1 does not respond, nginx will send the request to the next server (Server2), after 5 intents the server will be mark as disabled for 30s, and when a request come nginx will skip check Server1 until the 30s ends.

image::./assets/Server2 down.png[Server2 down, 450]
The same for the Server2

image::./assets/Server1 and Server2 down.png[Server1 and Server2 down, 450]
If all the servers are down, then nginx uses the backup server until one of the servers are again available
